Experimental Goals: 

Dataset: We will use the LOL dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/lol-dataset?resource=download)
which consists of 485 train and 15 test images with high and low resolution image pairs.
The image resolutions are 600x400.

If the resolution is too large for our computers or google COLAB, we will downsize the images by half, reducing them to 300x200.
Alternatively, we can shrink them to 150x100, reducing their size by one-fourth if needed.

If the model is too large even for batch size of 1, we will reduce the network sizes accordingly.

Qualitative Results: The authors present qualitative results on four LOL dataset images, which we will replicate and compare with our own results. Additionally, we will show results on other test images.
Quantitative Results: We will target the reproduction of FID, PSNR, and SSIM scores.
